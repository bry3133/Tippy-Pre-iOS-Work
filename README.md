## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
One of my first challenges was the erors that I got when I follow the instructions on the video tutorial. The Xcode became more modernize so I had to learn to adjust to the new syntax of different words. 

Another thing was putting the Settings bar button on the top of the screen. On the website when they showed us how to add the button, it forgot to talk about how to add the navigation screen before we do that. So when I tried to add the button, it didn’t appear on the top of the screen and did not connect wit the next screen. It was stressful but then I went online and looked up how to add buttons to the navigation bar and it helped a lot. 

Also, it was difficult trying to show the default percentage on the main screen after it was being chosen. I didn’t know what variable to connect and what code to write within both view controllers. However, I then did more research on my own about Swift and starting learn how to write more code for the apps. It will a lot of digging but it was worth it!

I attempted to add a custom tip percentange slider that would allow me to change the values to other numbers. However, I did not know how to sync the slider and the pre made percentanges. I tried to look it up online but I coudld not find enough information. If selected for CodePath, I would want to learn have to do this and UI animations. This is the first ever app I have written so I would like for you guys to consider the amount of knowledge I am eager and willing to learn in this class. I would love to gain more skills in the app development and technology so being in this class would be a really great oppotunity.
